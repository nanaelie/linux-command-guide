- `apg`:  Automated Password Generator - Standalone version
 APG (Automated Password Generator) is the tool set for random
 password generation. It generates some random words of required type
 and prints them to standard output. This binary package contains only
 the standalone version of apg.
 Advantages:
  * Built-in ANSI X9.17 RNG (Random Number Generator)(CAST/SHA1)
  * Built-in password quality checking system (now it has support for Bloom
    filter for faster access)
  * Two Password Generation Algorithms:
     1. Pronounceable Password Generation Algorithm (according to NIST
     2. Random Character Password Generation Algorithm with 35
        configurable modes of operation
  * Configurable password length parameters
  * Configurable amount of generated passwords
  * Ability to initialize RNG with user string
  * Support for /dev/random
  * Ability to crypt() generated passwords and print them as additional output.
  * Ability to log password generation requests for network version
  * Ability to use password generation service from any type of box (Mac,
    WinXX, etc.) that connected to network
  * Ability to enforce remote users to use only allowed type of password
    generation
 The client/server version of apg has been deliberately omitted.
 .
 Please note that there are security flaws in pronounceable
 password generation schemes (see Ganesan / Davis "A New Attack on
 Random Pronounceable Password Generators", in "Proceedings of the 17th

 The SUP System is a set of programs developed by Carnegie Mellon

 .
 SUP: The "client" program, run by users or system maintainers, which
 initiates the upgrade activity  on  a  machine  requesting  the
 run as a daemon, firing up once  each  night  (week,  etc.)  to
 upgrade the specified file collections.
 .
 SUPFILESRV: The "file server" program, a daemon that is run by the
 system maintainer to service requests for files initiated by client
 SUP programs.  The file server runs on every machine used as a
 "repository" of distributable versions of files.  It runs continuously
 and listens for network connection requests by individual client
 processes; for each individual client request, a process is forked to
 service that request.
 .
 periodically to speed up execution of the file server.  It
 pre-compiles a list of files on the file system that match the

 are upgraded by many clients each day; it is not so useful for small
 file collections or for those that are upgraded by only a few client
 machines per day.

 etc) keys is to print them out on paper.  The reasoning behind this is
 that paper and ink has amazingly long retention qualities - far longer
 than the magnetic or optical means that are generally used to back up
 computer data.
 .
 Due to metadata and redundancy, OpenPGP secret keys are significantly
 larger than just the "secret bits".  In fact, the secret key contains
 a complete copy of the public key.  Since the public key generally
 doesn't need to be escrowed (most people have many copies of it on
 various keyservers, web pages, etc), only extracting the secret parts
 can be a real advantage.
 .
 Paperkey extracts just those secret bytes and prints them.  To
 reconstruct, you re-enter those bytes (whether by hand or via OCR) and
 secret key.

 of external repositories that can be enabled by a simple command,
 example.com_repo".
