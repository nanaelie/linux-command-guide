# Système

Une commande système sous Linux est une instruction tapée dans le terminal (ou shell) qui permet à l'utilisateur ou à l'administrateur :

- de gérer le système d’exploitation,
- d’interagir avec le matériel,
- de lancer des programmes,
- ou de manipuler des fichiers et des processus.

Ces commandes sont fondamentales pour l’administration du système, la maintenance, la sécurité, et le bon fonctionnement général de Linux.
